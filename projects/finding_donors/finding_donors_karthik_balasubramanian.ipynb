    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "  We are posed with a classification problem to solve with a total of 103 features ( 5 continuous and 98 categorical). I could think of Random Forests, Gaussian Naive Bayes and  Support Vector Machine\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Real World application** - [Predicting customer buying behaviors in an ecommerce market](https://file.scirp.org/pdf/TEL_2018021215100508.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Strength** - The problem with decision trees is that they overfit the data they train on. I.e they memorize the data. But Random forest being an ensemble method, can control on the following \n",
    "        1. # of decision trees to build\n",
    "        2. # of features to use in a decision tree\n",
    "        3. min # of samples in a leaf node\n",
    "        4. min # of samples per split\n",
    "    Tuning these parameters help random forest perfom better than decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Weakness** - Random forests are easy to train but difficult to predict when the # of trees in the ensemble model is very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Why this model?** - I chose Random forest over decision tree classifier for this problem because there are many # of features and there are high chances that a single deicison tree model will become a victim for overfitting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Real World application** - Spam detection systems - (Udacity Video)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Strength** - Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier is particularly used when there are some features that are from the normal distribution. Basically Naive bayes's strength lies in its fast training phase, easier interpretability\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Weakness** - One of the strength of naive bayes can also become a weakness. Its naive assumptions that features are independent from one another - which makes the algo to train and run faster - can be wrong.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Why this model?** - this problem set is a classic example to find the posterier probality of the income groups given a person having 103 different features. From training set we can identify the probabilites of each feature given their income groups. We can also find prior probabilities of person being in an income group. From these two entities we can find the probability of a person belonging to the income group given the features. The maximum probabilities between the two classes of income groups becomes the predicted income group.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Real World Applications** - [Optical Character recognition](http://www12.tuiasi.ro/users/103/F2_2012_2_Tautu.pdf)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Strength** - Effective with large number of features, Conservative about memory utility - uses subset of training points ( support vectors) in the decision function. Has comman kernel implementation. But we can also extend to custom kernels. (Taken from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-classification)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Weakness** - If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial. ( Taken from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-classification)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Why this model?** - Since our model has 103 features (a lot), SVM implementation of Sklearn can easily find a support vector dimension that clearly divides the data into two income groups varing 102 other dimensions. \n",

    "I am given a dataset with 13 features (both numerical and categorical) and I have been asked to predict by charity ml team,  the income class of a person with these features. The income class will give an idea for Charity ML whether the person will donate or not before even they start pursuing their cause to the person. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our learning algorithms cannot directly understand categories in a feature. So we changed all non numerical features to numerical feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example. Sex => Is_Male (Yes/No), Is_Female(Yes/No)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the transformed dataset had a total of 103 features. Now our goal is to identify the income group of a person given his 103 features. This classic classification problem can be done with a decision graph (tree). But there are too many features, which means there are high chances that a decision graph (tree) could just memorize the data in hand ( training data) and may stumble when working to find the income class of the unseen data. So we randomly build n different decision graphs and decide the income group based on the majority vote income group from those n different graphs. This is very similar to how we take a decision when we have multiple opnions given we have no prior knowledge in the problem we are solving. This group decision making is confirmed (metric - accuracy of prediction) on a historic set of records (train set) so we are confident that our group decision making model works on new members sourced by charity ml (test data). This is how the proposed model for CharityML works."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "I got 4 out of 5 categories right. But the feature importance order was incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. capital-gain - Correct guess but I positioned it as 2. The people with more capital gains have good chance of running multiple business or cash flows in their day to day work which make them earn more than 50 k\n",
    "2. marital-status_Married-civ-spouse - Correct guess but i positioned it as 3. A category in Marital status, Married civ spouse contributed in identifying the income group of the person. From this we can understand that the chances of a married civilian male to earn more is high. \n",
    "3. education-num - Wrong guess but I had the similar idea and placed \"education\" a categorical variable as my #1 guess. education-num is a score provided based on the education category the person falls in. The higher number in education-num means more erudite the person is. So this confirms to my guess that more the person studies, the higher the chances of making more income.\n",
    "4. relationship_Husband - I did not get this assessment right. I learn from the model judgement that relationship is a crucial factor when it comes to predicting income and Married men earn more according to this dataset. \n",
    "5. age - My guess was right and my positioning for the guess was also correct. I confirm my underlying assumption the relationship age has with income. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was wrong with a prediction \"hours-per-week\". I understand that there are also people - who are not under a payroll- make more money. \n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
